Scrum Manager is designed to be an open-source application for managing the Scrum meetings within a team. The project is very early on in its lifecycle, and development is still quite a way from finishing.

The technical challenge of the project is to expose an API that would allow for information to be read and manipulated through: a website, a desktop application, and a mobile application. Information would sync between the devices, and they would all be able to interact together.
